# Web-Based Form Submission (Cybersecurity Lab Demo)

This project demonstrates how user input submitted through a web form can be collected using a third-party form backend (**Getform**).  
It was created as part of a cybersecurity learning exercise to understand how data flows from client-side forms to external endpoints in a controlled environment.

## Project Overview
A simple HTML and CSS based form sends user input to a Getform endpoint.  
Submitted data can be viewed through the Getform dashboard/link, helping visualize how form data is transmitted and stored.

This setup is used for educational purposes to study:
- Form data submission flow
- External endpoint integration
- Basic concepts of data collection in web applications

## Features
- Responsive form UI built with HTML and CSS  
- POST request submission to Getform endpoint  
- Ability to view submitted data via Getform dashboard/link  
- Basic required-field validation  
- Clean centered layout  

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Getform (form backend)

## Cybersecurity Context
This project is used in a controlled lab environment to understand how user input can be captured through web forms and why secure handling (HTTPS, validation, and backend security) is important in real applications.

No real user data is collected.

## Future Improvements
- Add client-side validation using JavaScript  
- Enable HTTPS  
- Store submissions in a local database  
- Implement authentication for accessing submitted data
